                Your phone, wallet, or even your student ID—losing important items can be stressful and frustrating, especially when there’s no clear system in place to help students locate their belongings. Many rely on word-of-mouth, random social media posts, or scattered bulletin board notices, but these methods are unreliable and often ineffective. Without an organized lost-and-found process, students are left with little hope of retrieving their lost possessions. This common problem inspired the development of the 
                <strong>"Until I Found You" Lost & Found Management System</strong>, a digital solution designed to simplify and improve the way lost items are reported and recovered on campus.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The system provides an easy-to-use platform where students can report missing items, browse found objects, and communicate with finders or owners—all in one convenient place. With features like categorized listings, image uploads, and a built-in messaging system, users can quickly identify and verify lost belongings. 
                <span class="highlight">Real-time notifications</span> alert students when an item matching their description is found, eliminating the need for endless searching. Additionally, a secure login system ensures that only verified users can interact on the platform, protecting personal information and preventing false claims. The responsive interface is designed to work smoothly on both computers and mobile devices, making it accessible anytime, anywhere.
