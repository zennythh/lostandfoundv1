            <h2>Until I Found You | Lost & Found Management System</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Imagine losing your student ID right before an important exam or misplacing your wallet after a long day on campus.</strong>
            The frustration, anxiety, and time spent searching can be overwhelming. Many students rely on word-of-mouth, random social media posts,
            or scattered bulletin board notices, but these methods are unreliable and often ineffective. The need for a structured, campus-wide lost
            and found solution inspired the creation of <strong>"Until I Found You"</strong>, a digital system designed to streamline and improve
            how lost items are reported and recovered.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system provides an easy-to-use platform where students can report missing items, browse found objects, and communicate with finders or owners
            ‚Äîall in one convenient place. With features like categorized listings, image uploads, and a built-in messaging system, users can quickly identify
            and verify lost belongings. <strong>Real-time notifications</strong> alert students when an item matching their description is found, eliminating
            the need for endless searching. Additionally, a secure login system ensures that only verified users can interact on the platform, protecting personal
            information and preventing false claims.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Key Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <p>üîπ <strong>Secure & Verified Access:</strong> Only registered students and staff can report or claim lost items.</p>
                <p>üîπ <strong>Instant Alerts:</strong> Get notified immediately when your lost item is found.</p>
                <p>üîπ <strong>Image Uploads:</strong> Easily identify items with clear pictures instead of vague descriptions.</p>
                <p>üîπ <strong>Effortless Communication:</strong> Use the built-in chat to coordinate item returns securely.</p>
                <p>üîπ <strong>Mobile-Friendly:</strong> Access the system on any device, anytime, anywhere.</p>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            More than just a lost-and-found tool, <strong>"Until I Found You"</strong> fosters a sense of community and responsibility among students. It encourages
            honesty by making it easy for finders to return lost items, reducing the number of unclaimed belongings left on campus. By streamlining the lost-and-found
            process, the system saves time, minimizes stress, and helps students recover their valuables more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>With just a few clicks, you can report or search for lost belongings‚Äîmaking item recovery faster and more reliable.</strong> Join the community and
            never worry about losing something important again!

                        to the log-in page and then in the main dashboard, where you can report a lost item or browse found items.

                    </p>

                        Use the <strong>‚ÄúSearch Items‚Äù</strong> page to find your lost belongings. You can filter results by item type, 
                        location, or date found. Each listing will include a description and an image. You may also set up notifications 
                        to be alerted when a matching item is found.

                    <p>
                        If your lost item is listed, click on it and select <strong>‚ÄúClaim‚Äù</strong>. Provide proof of ownership 
                        (such as a receipt, detailed description, or identifying marks). The finder may request further verification 
                        before handing over the item.

                    <h3>Step 5: Submit a Found Item</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you found an item, submit a report under the <strong>‚ÄúFound Items‚Äù</strong> section. Include an image, 
                        date, and location details to help the owner recognize it. The system will attempt to match it with existing lost 
                        item reports and notify potential owners.

                    <h3>Step 6: Use the Chat Feature</h3>
                    <p>
                        The system offers a <strong>secure chat feature</strong> where finders and owners can coordinate safely 
                        without sharing personal contact details. The chat ensures privacy and security while arranging pickup details. 
                        Please be respectful and only use the chat for its intended purpose.

                    <h3>Step 7: Complete the Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once an item is returned to its rightful owner, the finder should mark it as <strong>‚ÄúReturned‚Äù</strong> in the system. 
                        Similarly, the owner should confirm the successful retrieval of their item. This helps keep the database up-to-date 
                        and prevents unnecessary duplicate reports.
